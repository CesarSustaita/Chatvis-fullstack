[20.06.19, 15:59:14] Emily: Yes
[20.06.19, 15:59:15] Loris: Good
[20.06.19, 15:59:40] Loris: I think we can start a fake conversation then üëç
[20.06.19, 15:59:45] Loris: I'd like to start with some features
[20.06.19, 15:59:50] Loris: First up: you can see images when you upload a .zip file that was exported with the "Attach media" option.
[20.06.19, 16:00:03] John: Really?
[20.06.19, 16:00:10] Loris: Yes! Let me show you:
[20.06.19, 16:00:15] Loris: <attached: 00000001-PHOTO-2019-06-20-16-00-15.jpg>
[20.06.19, 16:00:35] Emily: Cool
[20.06.19, 16:00:52] John: Can you share a video too?
[20.06.19, 16:01:18] Emily: I agree, that would be nice üé•
[20.06.19, 16:01:40] Loris: Sure, here we go:
[20.06.19, 16:01:42] Loris: <attached: 00000002-VIDEO-2019-06-20-16-01-42.mp4>
[20.06.19, 16:01:47] John: So that's it?
[20.06.19, 16:03:04] Loris: I have more...
[20.06.19, 16:03:07] Emily: Come on...
don't be so mysterious and show us!
[20.06.19, 16:03:38] Loris: Ok, let me share an audio file then üéµ
[20.06.19, 16:03:55] Loris: <attached: 00000003-AUDIO-2019-06-20-16-03-55.mp3>
[20.06.19, 16:04:04] John: üòç
[20.06.19, 16:04:18] Emily: Sounds good man, I like it!
[20.06.19, 16:04:21] Loris: Cool, now I'd like to share another file,
this one is a file that is not an image/audio/video, so it becomes a link that you can download!
[20.06.19, 16:04:37] Loris: <attached: 00000004-whatsapp-chat-parser-example.zip>
[20.06.19, 16:04:44] Loris: (That's the old chat example BTW üëÄ)
[20.06.19, 16:04:52] Loris: Cool right? Whenever a file can't be reproduced via <img>, <video> or <audio> it becomes a link.
[20.06.19, 16:05:13] Emily: That's a nice feature.
[20.06.19, 16:06:25] Loris: Thanks üôÇ
[20.06.19, 16:07:19] John: I like it too
[20.06.19, 16:07:21] Loris: Good
[20.06.19, 16:07:22] Loris: So, next would be an external link that you can click:
